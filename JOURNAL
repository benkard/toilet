**  Another Random Piece of Vaporware is Born

Here I go again, starting yet another little pet software project whose
chance of surviving for more than a few months is limited, but hey, it'd
not be me if I didn't start bragging about it before having written even
a single line of code, right?  So here we go!

I intend Mulklisp (which is obviously a preliminary, WebShaka-style
proto-name) to become a Lisp compiler for the Étoilé runtime (and maybe
Mac OS X as well, but that's of a lower priority) with the following
features:

 * A proper subset of ANSI Common Lisp, with an eye towards full ANSI
   compliance in the far future.
 * CFFI support.
 * Lexical **and** dynamic scoping.
 * Integration with the Étoilé object system.
 * DEFMACRO.
 * Hygienic macros by way of Explicit Renaming and Syntactic Closures.
 * Read macros. (?)
 * TAGBODY and GO. (?)
 * CATCH and THROW. (?)
 * Places (that is, SETF).
 * A package system.
 * Arrays and hash tables compatible with their Common Lisp counterparts,
   but based on the Étoilé/GNUstep ones.
 * Direct compilation to Étoilé runtime code (as with Étoilé Smalltalk).
 * A REPL.
 * Conditions and restarts.
 * Multiple namespaces.
 * Bignums and rationals.
 * JIT and explicit compilation (COMPILE) via LLVM. (?)
 * Optional static typing with Cells-based/Hindley-Milner/whatever type
   inference. (?)

Well, that's what I'm dreaming of.  At least now you have something new
to joke about in place of Duke Nukem Forever (which is coming out
Practically Tomorrow!  Preorder today!).

Maybe I ought to change my nickname from Kompottkin to Vaporwarepottkin.
