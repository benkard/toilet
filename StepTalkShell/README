    StepTalk > _

Now you may write statements in the language you have specified.

    StepTalk > Transcript showLine:'Current date is ', ((NSDate date) description)
    
If the line is too long, then you may use the backslash '\' character at the end
of the line to continue on the next line.

    StepTalk > Transcript showLine:'Current date is ', \
    ... ? ((NSDate date) description)

Objects history array
---------------------
All results from the expressions are stored in the 'Objects' array. The example
above can be written in more steps:

    StepTalk > ((NSDate date) description)
    0: 2002-05-29 22:41:57 +0200
    StepTalk > 'Current date is ', (Objects @ 0)
    1: Current date is 2002-05-29 22:41:57 +0200
    StepTalk > Transcript showLine: (Objects @ 1)
    Current date is 2002-05-29 22:41:57 +0200
    
To show all objects type:

    StepTalk > Shell listObjects
    Objects
       0: '2002-05-29 22:41:57 +0200' (GSCInlineString)
       1: 'Current date is 2002-05-29 22:41:57 +020...' (GSUnicodeString)
